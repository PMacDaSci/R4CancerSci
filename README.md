# Introduction

This site contains the materials for an R course run by Peter Mac.

The materials were adapted from the course run by the Bioinformatics Core
at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute (Contributions : Matthew Eldridge, Chandra Chilamakuri, Mark Fernandes, Ashley Sawle, Kamal Kishore, Sergio Martinez Cuesta, Rory Stark).

April 2022

### Instructors

* Maria Doyle, Research Computing
* Cassie Litchfield, Bioinformatics Core

# Description

**R** is one of the leading programming languages in **Data Science** and the
most widely used within Peter Mac for interacting with, analyzing and visualizing cancer biology datasets. In this training, we aim to provide **a friendly next-steps R course for beginners** who have been through an introductory R training course and would like to consolidate their skills using cancer research data. It is an opportunity for increasing skills through supported practice with exercises as part of a class and to ask questions/get help.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course you should be able to:  

* Interact comfortably with R using RStudio  
* Import/export data (e.g. Excel, csv files) into/from R  
* Manipulate and reformat tabular data  
* Create visualisations (scatterplots, bar charts, boxplots, histograms and line graphs for time series data)  
* Generate reproducible reports for your analyses

# This course is for you if

* You've completed DataCamp's [Introduction to the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) (contact Maria Doyle if you need access) and are looking to build on your skills. Alternatively, previous attendance at University of Melbourne's [Introduction to R](https://gateway.research.unimelb.edu.au/events/researcher-connect#digital-skills-training) or equivalent is sufficient. 
* You have ~1-2 hours to spend on the course each week during the 4 weeks (working through material and exercises in your own time at your own pace) and are able to attend all 4 live 1hr (recap/discussion/Q&A) sessions.

The course will be run over **4 sessions** with the following structure:

* **Material** covering the concepts introduced in the lesson to go through in your own time
* An **assignment** consisting of exercises to practice some of the concepts covered in that and previous lessons
* A weekly **live recap, discussion, Q&A session** lasting 1hr (hybrid format online and in-person if possible)
* **Teams channel** for the class to ask any questions or get help in-between the live sessions

# Schedule

**Course setup** [Installing R and RStudio](https://mblue9.github.io/Bite-size-R-v2/articles/week0.html)

1. [Introduction to this course, RStudio, R Markdown](https://mblue9.github.io/Bite-size-R-v2/articles/week1.html) - Interacting with R using RStudio, importing data into R, generating and editing a reproducible report. 

2. [Data visualization with ggplot2](https://mblue9.github.io/Bite-size-R-v2/articles/week2.html)  - A common grammar to create scatter plots, bar charts, boxplots, histograms and line graphs for time series data. 

3. [Data manipulation using dplyr](https://mblue9.github.io/Bite-size-R-v2/articles/week3.html)  - Filtering and modifying tabular data, computing summary values, faceting with ggplot2. 

4. [Grouping, combining,and restructuring data for analysis](https://mblue9.github.io/Bite-size-R-v2/articles/week4.html) - Advanced grouping and summarization operations, joining data from different tables, the concept of 'tidy data', pivoting and separating operations, customizing ggplot2 plots. 

**Competition!** Submit an Rmd report showing some of the skills you've learned, using the course data or your own data, as simple or as complex as you like. Submit after the course ends, by May 24th. Best report will win a small prize.
